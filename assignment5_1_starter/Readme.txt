Key Findings - I focused on takeout/carryaway data which represented about 2,300 observations.  Coupon usage was high overall and only a few factors played an important role in coupon usage (or not)
	•	Overall acceptance is high (~73–75%), but varies
	•	Time of day: peak acceptance at 2PM (87%) and 6PM (83%), lowest in the early morning (7AM, 65%).
	•	Weather conditions: acceptance is higher in sunny weather (76%), lower in rainy (61%).
	•	Education & Occupation:
	•	Higher acceptance among those with some high school (94%), Associate’s degrees (82%), and service/technical fields (often 80–100%).
	•	Lower acceptance in professional fields like legal (54%) or science (50%).
